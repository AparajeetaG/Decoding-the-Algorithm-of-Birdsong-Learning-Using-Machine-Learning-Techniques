# Decoding-the-Algorithm-of-Birdsong-Learning-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project leverages CNN to decode birdsong motifs, assesses model performance with rigorous metrics, and explores miR-128's role in learning, with implications for treating language disorders.
In the context of my research project, which aims at the computational modeling of birdsong learning with a focus on motif detection, I developed an advanced model leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) to analyze audio recordings of birdsong. By extracting key acoustic features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and chromagrams, I aimed to capture the intricate structure of birdsong. To ensure the robustness of my model and prevent overfitting, I implemented strategies like cross-validation, batch normalization, and dropout.

The significance of miR-128 inhibition in the context of my model and its potential implications for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients with language disorders is particularly noteworthy. miR-128 is a microRNA involved in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory processes. In the neural circuitry of birdsong, miR-128 plays a pivotal role in the fine-tuning of song production and the learning of complex motifs, akin to how humans acquire and refine language skills.

By investigating the inhibition of miR-128, my research seeks to understand how reducing the levels of this microRNA could potentially enhance neural plasticity and facilitate the learning process in birds. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that similar mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and neural circuit modulation underlie both birdsong learning and human language acquisition. Therefore, by drawing parallels from the effects of miR-128 inhibition on birdsong learning, we can hypothesize potential therapeutic targets for improving language learning and communication in individuals with ASD.

Individuals with ASD often face significant challenges in language and communication, which can be attributed to differences in neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity. If the inhibition of miR-128 can lead to enhanced song learning in birds by promoting neural plasticity, a similar strategy might be employed to facilitate language acquisition and communication in ASD patients. This could open up new avenues for the development of novel interventions aimed at modulating synaptic plasticity to improve language and communication skills in individuals with ASD.

In summary, the development of my new model for detecting bird song motifs not only advances our understanding of the complex patterns in birdsong but also serves as a foundational step towards exploring neurobiological interventions for language disorders in humans. Through the lens of miR-128 inhibition and its effects on neural plasticity, my project offers insights that could translate into novel therapeutic strategies for addressing communication deficits in conditions like Autism Spectrum Disorder.
